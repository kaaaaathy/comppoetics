  As a class, we are going to create a google doc of rewritten computer history materials.
  <br><br>
  For this 1-week assignment, find 1-3 articles/links/zines/media that you would like in a syllabus about computer history. How would we incubate a less white supremacist, patriarchal computer history?

  <br><br>
  Post these to the working google doc: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/comppoetics-reindex" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/comppoetics-reindex</a>. If someone posts yours, feel free to repost to emphasize; try to find another. We will discuss/respond to each link in class 2.

      Transcribe 500-750 words of any text. It must be done by you, manually. This project is less about form and more about experience + process.
      <br>
      <br>
      Consider your source text:
      <li>Is it already presented as digital, parsable text?
      <li>Is it archived as a printed or written object (or otherwise not-presently machine readable)?
      <li>How spatial is it? (e.g. a set of unrelated receipts on the table, a set of street names)
      <br>

      <br><br>
      In a few sentences in the Slack, articulate how transcription feels as a method of transformation. Note the bodily and mental experience of translation. Note the decisions you make when you are translating it. In which ways does it feel neutral, or opinionated?

    Create a text-based browser project which uses variability and randomness in some way. This project will build on our in-class knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript.
    <br>
    Themes from class which might inspire your project: oracles, divination, weather machines, horoscopes, things which tell the future.
    <br>
    <li> Must, at minimum, use randomness in some way
    <li> Must demonstrate a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and calling an array by index
    <li> You can use an existing text (i.e. a poem, piece of news, etc) or you can write your own.
    <br>

    <b>To consider:</b> How do computational ingredients affect the nature of the text? How does the literal and metaphorical concepts randomness, repetition, score transform the textâ€™s meaning? How might randomness become a metaphor for uncertainty, or statistical chaos, or things defying statistical reason? (e.g. Lillian Yvonne Bertram)

    Create a project with a focus on embodiment/interface/avatar and collective voice. This project:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Must draw a relationship between two or more pieces of text by different authors (one of them can be you)
    <li>Must be performed for the class over zoom (or you can share a recording of the performance)
    <li>Can use any medium of language expression: text, audio based, etc. Will you perform it? Will you use a voice interface other than yourself? Will it be silent?

    <br><br>
    <b>To consider:</b> How does the embodiment of the text shift the relationship between the original text(s)? Will you reveal difference between all/both voices, or channel through a disambiguating singular body?
