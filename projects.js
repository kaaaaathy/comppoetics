    content: `
  Decide on a short research topic to share with the class next week, relating to the history of computers, society, from a lens of resistance— decolonial, anti-surveillance, intersectionally feminist, all of the above...
  <br><br>
  <img src="imgs/abtec.jpg" class="imageCaption"><br><span class="imageCaption">ABTEC Island, Skawennati</span>
  <br><br>
  Bring at least 1 historical reference—for instance, the invention of the jacquard loom and its effect on labor. How women in World Wars encoded secret knit messages into sweaters. Or QuiPu as an indigeneous mode of data storage.
  <br><br>
  Share also 2-3 examples of contemporary computational artworks which aligns with your theme.This can be projects, writings, initiatives from artists, advocates, policy makers working recently. For instance, anti-surveillance workshops or browser extensions, or sex worker demands to sell sex on the internet.
  <br><br>

  Post these to the working <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mftukhE-jKbmGdWJ5fG7sBlNk3Cbj_5aBPrirgAKyh0/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">google doc</a>. For each reference, add it to the shared google doc with an image, link, and a short description. Be prepared to informally present with the class.

In one week, apply these principles of glitching to a piece of text. Create at least 5 images which incorporate the “glitch” and language.

To share your project, create a website which hosts your response as embedded images, and include a short description (100+) of your process and intent.
<br><br>Since this is a one week project, think of it more like an exercise and experimentation than a fully-fleshed out project.
Post your glitches in the Discord #projects channel.

    content: `
      Inspired by Allison Parrish's artistic and pedagogical practice in <a href="https://hsnlp.decontextualize.com/" target="_blank">"human-scale" language models</a>: we will create a collective small-scale data set in class. Each person should find 3,000–5,000 words of text which should be sourced in-line with your values / our class values. In class, we will put them all in one document and, in pairs, either write simple code or write a set of rules to create something visual using some or all of the collective corpus.

    Create a text-based browser project which uses variability and randomness in some way. This project will build on our in-class knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript.

    Themes from class which might inspire your project: oracles, divination, weather machines, horoscopes, things which tell the future.
    <br>
    <li> Must, at minimum, use randomness in some way
    <li> Must demonstrate a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and calling an array by index
    <li> You can use an existing text (i.e. a poem, piece of news, etc) or you can write your own.

    To consider: How do computational ingredients affect the nature of the text? How does the literal and metaphorical concepts of randomness, repetition, score transform the text’s meaning?

    content: `
    Create a project which brings together two or more authors (one of them can be you). This project might touch on themes of hypertext, collective writing, or authorship and found text as writing. It might touch on feedback loops and crowdsourcing. Perhaps writing becomes something of a collage. This project:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Must draw a relationship between two or more pieces of text by different authors (one of them can be you)
    <li>Must be performed for the class
    <li>Can use any medium of language expression: text, audio based, etc. Will you perform it? Will you use a voice interface other than yourself? Will it be silent?

    <b>To consider:</b> How does the embodiment of the text shift the relationship between the original text(s)? Will you reveal difference between all/both voices, or channel through a disambiguating singular body?

    For the first week, come in with 1-2 ideas of project directions for working with a data set. You might use the same dataset for both, or consider two different sets.
    <br>e.g. I will collect every cloud I see on my walk.
    <br>e.g. I will collect every comment made to me about X
    <br>e.g. I will work with City of Providence data about Y
    <br><br>
    Focus on the process of data collection in your reflections. You should bring 40 total items to class. If they are something intangible, like hyperlinks, print out a tangible representation of it, such as a website.
