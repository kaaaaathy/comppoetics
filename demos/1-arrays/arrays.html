  // OK! Now we are going to play with arrays.
  // An array is basically a list of stuff. You can fill it with lots of object types, like variables, numbers, words (strings) etc.
  //

  // Here is where the array lives.
  var numbers = [0,1,2,3];

  // I can "retrieve" what the list is by printing it to the console.
  console.log(numbers);

  // This is going to tell me what the first (0th) item in the list is.
  console.log("The first number is" + numbers[0]);

  // This is going to tell me the length of the list
  console.log("The length of the list numbers is" + numbers.length);

  // This is going to return all the numbers in the list
  for (i=0; i < numbers.length;i++){
    console.log("Numbers contains the number " + numbers[i]);
  }

  // Give me a random number between 0 and 1
  console.log(Math.random());

  // Give me a random number anywhere between 0 and the length of my list
  console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*numbers.length));




  // Numbers are great but how does this work with text?
  // Let's do the same thing.
  var colors = ["vermillion", "rose", "tangerine", "sky blue", "orange","teal","navy"];

  console.log(colors);

  console.log("Sometimes I feel " + colors[0]);

  // Adding randomness
  console.log("Other days I randomly feel " + colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)]);
